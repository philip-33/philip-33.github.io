            <br><h4>Getting Started</h4>
            <br>Types of Web Developers
            <br>* Front-end developers deal with the parts that users interface with and use HTML/CSS, javascript
            <br>* Back-end developers focus on parts of the website that run on servers and handle data processing in the background
            <br>* Web developers are expected to have an understanding of the “full stack” which refers to both front and back-end together, but generally specialize in one or the other.
            <br>The role of HTML
            <br>* Important for everyone to know, defines structure and data on a webpage
            <br>* Front-end developers are required to understand the Information Architecture (IA)
            <br>* Tags that create the structure of a page and the IA work together to create the DOM
            <br>* Foundational to all roles in this field
            <br>The role of CSS
            <br>* Drives the experience of the website and how content is displayed to the user
            <br>* Defines how the DOM is translated into visual form
            <br>* CSS Zen Garden is an example of a single HTML document displayed in different ways
            <br>The role of Javascript
            <br>* Javascript interacts with the DOM: Handling events, load/unload media, create/modify/delete page elements
            <br>* Used as part of the interface with front-end, also handles back-end tasks like compression or workflow management
            <br>Back end essentials
            <br>* Each company has a different stack (set of programs/libraries/tools) that they use
            <br>* All web developers need to know at least one stack for working with websites (video recommends: PHP + SQL)
            <br>Servers
            <br>* This hosts the files for the site and manages presentation to the user.
            <br>* Back-end developers manage the site and services, front-end developers manage the interface/experience
            <br>* Install your own stack to practice at home
            <br>Server-side scripting
            <br>* Main languages are PHP, nodeJS, .NET, ASP.NET, Ruby, Python
            <br>* Important to know how to use more than 1 platform. Some are agnostic and run on multiple systems. Others are specific, like ASP.NET runs only on Windows.
            <br>Database languages
            <br>* SQL creates tables, like spreadsheets, that link data on tables with relationships
            <br>* NoSQL represents a new direction for databases, as they lack a traditional relational structure
            <br>
            <br><h4>Learning and Training</h4>
            <br>Train for the industry
            <br>* Multiple ways to learn to be a web developer, 70% of whom are self-taught
            <br>* Read documentation, examine other developer’s code, explore new ideas
            <br>* Making mistakes makes you a better developer
            <br>Traditional education
            <br>* College education means that developers are able to think more deeply about subjects
            <br>* General education provides a wide base of experience and higher math classes can help with some aspects of development
            <br>* These skills provide a higher overall earning potential vs bootcamps and self-study
            <br>Coding bootcamps
            <br>* Quickly teach common skills for development, and 88% placement rate within a few months
            <br>* 10-12 weeks of intense training.
            <br>* 79% of camp students already have a bachelor’s degree
            <br>Other learning options
            <br>* Online learning is a key way to keep up with a rapidly changing industry
            <br>* Some sites are highly focused such as a Slack run by a company to provide a community with access to their developers, or broad like stackoverflow where people can ask questions and different answers are voted on by the other forum members.
            <br>Social learning opportunities
            <br>* ~30% of all developers got their jobs from a friend, <20% got them by applying through a website.
            <br>* Conferences and meetups are ways to get involved socially, but be genuine and find events that interest you
            <br>Core developer tools
            <br>* 3 tools to master: Your editor (IDE), Terminal (CLI), Browser
            <br>* Sites can be built with these alone, and they must be mastered
            <br>Other essential tools
            <br>* Data visualization is helpful for dealing with databases (phpMyAdmin)
            <br>* Version control is done with git/github
            <br>* Workflow tools help with common processes for making websites (minifying, transpiling)
            <br>* Frameworks help you build websites with sets of prebuilt code
            <br>Core concepts
            <br>* Employers are more interested in developers that are able to make sites that are more accessible to larger numbers of people
            <br>* Employers appreciate developers that are familiar with Software Engineering workflows such as agile development processes that work in 2-week springs
            <br>* Test-driven development creates code and tests the code at the same time
            <br>Business and leadership skills
            <br>* Communication skills (non-confrontational) are critical for necessary team work
            <br>* It includes presenting and defending your ideas and work is also necessary
            <br>* Github with code examples is critical
            <br>* Salary negotiation skills are mandatory
            <br>
            <br><h4>Getting a Job</h4>
            <br>Types of jobs
            <br>* True full-stack dev is a unicorn
            <br>* Remote devs have higher job satisfaction
            <br>* More talented developers will have an easier time finding well paying, interesting work
            <br>Maximize compensation
            <br>* $65K is average web developer salary
            <br>* $100K is median developer salary with 5 years experience (full-stack), $97K for front end
            <br>* For various levels of education, a small amount of experience leads to $100K+ salary
            <br>Land a job
            <br>* Referrals, no really.
            <br>* Recruiters via meetups
            <br>* Find people in a company that you want to get hired with</p>
