      <p><b>Thelonious Sphere Monk</b> (/θəˈloʊniəs/, October 10, 1917 – February 17, 1982) was an American jazz pianist and composer. Monk had a unique improvisational style and made numerous contributions to the standard jazz repertoire, including "'Round Midnight", "Blue Monk", "Straight, No Chaser", "Ruby, My Dear", "In Walked Bud", and "Well, You Needn't". Monk is the second most-recorded jazz composer after Duke Ellington, which is particularly remarkable as Ellington composed more than a thousand pieces, whereas Monk wrote about 70.)</p>

      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>Thelonious Sphere Monk was born two years after his sister Marion on October 10, 1917, in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. Monk started playing the piano at the age of six and was largely self-taught. He attended Stuyvesant High School but did not graduate.</p>
      
      <h4>Career</h4>
      <p>He toured with an evangelist in his teens, playing the church organ, and in his late teens he began to find work playing jazz. In the early to mid-1940s, Monk was the house pianist at Minton's Playhouse, a Manhattan nightclub. Monk's musical work at Minton's was crucial in the formulation of <b>bebop</b>, which would be furthered along by other artists, including <i>Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Christian, Kenny Clarke, Charlie Parker,</i> and later, <i>Miles Davis</i>.</p>
      <p>Monk made his first recordings as leader for Blue Note in 1947 (later anthologised on <em>Genius of Modern Music, Vol. 1</em>), which showcased his talents as a composer of original melodies for improvisation.</p>
      <p>In August 1951, New York City police searched a parked car occupied by Monk and friend Bud Powell. They found narcotics in the car, presumed to have belonged to Powell. Monk refused to testify against his friend, so the police confiscated his New York City Cabaret Card. Without this, Monk was unable to play in any New York venue where liquor was served, and this severely restricted his ability to perform for several years. Monk spent most of the early and mid 1950s composing, recording, and performing at theaters and out-of-town gigs.</p>
      <p>From 1955 to 1961, Monk was under contract with Riverside Records. After having his cabaret card restored, Monk relaunched his New York career with a landmark six-month residency at the Five Spot Cafe in the East Village neighborhood of New York beginning in June 1957. After extended negotiations, Monk signed in 1962 with Columbia Records, one of the big four American record labels of the day. Monk continued to record studio albums, including <em>Criss Cross</em> from 1963, and <em>Underground</em>, from 1968.</p>
      
      <h4>Later Life</h4>
      <p>Monk had disappeared from the scene by the mid 1970s and made only a small number of appearances during the final decade of his life. His last studio recordings as a leader were made in November 1971 for the English Black Lion label, near the end of a worldwide tour with the Giants of Jazz.</p>
      <p>As his health declined, Monk's last six years were spent as a guest in the Weehawken, New Jersey, home of his long-standing patron and friend, Baroness Pannonica "Nica" de Koenigswarter. He died of a stroke on February 17, 1982, and was buried in Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York. In 1993, he was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.</p>
