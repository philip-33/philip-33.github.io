        <p>Lecture: Wordpress Ecommerce Core Concepts
                <br><h4>Understanding your market</h4>
                <br>Choosing a product to sell
                <br>There are a lot of considerations to make before making an online store: Areas of interest, types of products, defining an audience
                <br>The primary distinction for products are virtual and physical. Each has their own set of logistics and considerations for your site.
                <br>Defining your audience
                <br>Figuring out your customer base is done by modeling potential customers (personas)
                <br>Using a single persona is best for sites at the beginning, and will drive site decisions in the future as more details are added
                <br>Organizing your products
                <br>Bundling products help users understand it better
                <br>An alternative to bundles is to have a single, customizable product or a subscription service
                <br>Offering pre-sales to validate your product
                <br>Product validation is a way to limit risk when starting a new venture.
                <br>Kickstarter, selling a single product, or pre-orders are good ways to gauge interest in your product
                <br>
                <br><h4>Marketing your site</h4>
                <br>Using marketing to increase site traffic
                <br>Increasing traffic requires time, money, or both
                <br>SEO is a critical component of this, and ties into social media
                <br>Understanding customer lifetime value (CLV)
                <br>CLV is a measure of profit over the lifetime of a customer. This value needs to be greater than the cost of acquiring the customer
                <br>Bundles, newsletters, and upselling are examples of known methods of increasing CLV
                <br>Increasing CLV with repeat customers
                <br>Consumable products result in continual sales, otherwise social media is a subtle reminder
                <br>Autoresponders can be used to reach out to customers that have made purchases for a category of product (blueberry flavored stuff), or have not engaged with your site for an extended period
                <br>Increasing your average order value
                <br>By creatively bundling expensive products (yoga mat + bag + cleaner), more expensive items seem reasonable
                <br>Cross-selling and upselling are other ways to increase order value, and are often configurable from a dashboard
                <br>Free shipping at <price point> is a good tactic
                <br>
                <br><h4>Selling Products</h4>
                <br>Getting paid
                <br>Payment taken from customer by payment gateway
                <br>Traditional gateway uses merchant account and CC payment. Modern gateway does not require merchant account
                <br>Only capture a verified charge when the product ships
                <br>Examining your needs
                <br>Multiple ways to take payments (stripe, paypal, amazon, CC gateway)
                <br>Analyze risk before deciding on a method
                <br>Checking out with PayPal
                <br>PP can integrate with some sites, hiding it’s existence until the checkout process goes to PayPal
                <br>Excellent for just getting started
                <br>Checking out with Stripe
                <br>This functions just like PP, except “Credit Card” is selected as default payment method. 
                <br>After entering CC info, payment is authorized on the same page, and the payment is complete.
                <br>
                <br><h4>Shipping, Orders, Taxes</h4>
                <br>Calculating shipping costs
                <br>Flat Rate: single, easy cost to calculate shipping ($5 + $2 per item)
                <br>Estimates require accounts with shippers and your site needs to communicate through their apis
                <br>Anything beyond flat rate takes time and is not recommended to start
                <br>Managing orders
                <br>Wordpress stores hopefully include user roles for customers/managers by default
                <br>With physical product, broken orders are inevitable. For refunds, not all gateways can handle this from the API. Investigate refund process first!
                <br>Managing inventory and listings across platforms
                <br>Brand reach increases with additional sites to list products
                <br>Different platforms have different focuses (sales, inventory, accounting, shipping)
                <br>Understanding taxes
                <br>Charged based on nexus (physical presence), collected once
                <br>Some payment gateways simplify payments and do not take billing details
                <br>Reach out to a tax professional
                <br>Collecting EU value-added tax (VAT)
                <br>VAT is europe’s version of sales tax, rolled into the cost of each item
                <br>A good service will automatically calculate these for you, including taking into account location based on self-report and IP
                <br>
                <br><h4>Securing your site</h4>
                <br>Understanding the basics of SSL
                <br>More security == more sales
                <br>SSL encrypts all data between your website and customers. Mandatory for payments, but optional for browsing and cart management.
                <br>Protecting sensitive data
                <br>HTTPS should be forced for the entire site whenever possible
                <br>Additionally, all logins should be over https
                <br>
                <br><h4>Using Wordpress for Ecommerce</h4>
                <br>Using native Wordpress platforms
                <br>WP is open source, so many features are provided for free and can be freely replaced as necessary
                <br>More advanced platforms require payment to access all features or are payment based because of specific functionality
                <br>Implementing third-party platforms
                <br>When picking a 3rd party platform, be aware of features, limitations, costs associated with it. The wrong one will significantly hamper your efforts
                <br>Knowing how your site will work and what it needs to function is critical here.
                <br>
                <br><h4>Testing and Optimization</h4>
                <br>Testing your site
                <br>Test the cart and checkout process. It is the most critical. Second is the shipping
                <br>Final test is for payment gateways, then the rest of your site (membership, pricing, newsletters, services).
                <br>Small errors now = major problems later
                <br>Optimizing your site
                <br>When optimizing for ecommerce, data analytics by yoast is a solution with free and paid components
                <br>Good user research can identify problems on your site
