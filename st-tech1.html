        <p>     <br><h4>Introduction to the Web</h4>
                <br>Understanding how the web works
                <br>* Internet and web are not the same thing
                <br>* There are many types of web servers that specialize in different types of data
                <br>Working with clients and servers
                <br>* Clients request data from servers with a URL that is translated by DNS into an IP
                <br>* Static sites process most of the data on the client, while dynamic sites process some data on the server and present it to the client
                <br>The DNS and why it matters
                <br>* DNS is a global, distributed database with authoritative root servers
                <br>* Each TLD (.com, .edu, etc) has its own DNS server
                <br>Internet protocols
                <br>* The Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) is a collection of protocols that includes HTTP, FTP, and others to allow sharing of information
                <br>* The suite can be broken down into multiple layers that separate protocols based on whether they present information to a user, manage addressing, facilitate transport between network nodes, or connect individual devices
                <br>Exploring HTTP
                <br>* FTP: used for files, SMTP: used for mail, RTP: used for video
                <br>* Stateless, so other methods need to be used to save data between transmissions (cookies, javascript, etc)
                <br>Anatomy of a URL
                <br>* As long as it is recognized by the server, any protocol can be used
                <br>* Scripting can be used to request data from the server using the URL
                <br>How browsers work
                <br>* Servers can serve any type of data, but it can only be viewed in the browser if the browser supports that file type
                <br>* Different browsers, and even different versions of the same browser, can have different rendering engines
                <br>Web standards and the W3C
                <br>* W3C started in 1994 and issued recommendations for web technologies
                <br>* The Web Standards Project branded these recommendations as standards :/
                <br>Web server basics
                <br>* Web servers usually use a shared hosting environment where multiple sites are hosted on the same server, but dedicated options are available.
                <br>* LAMP: Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP (or Perl, or Python)
                <br>
                <br><h4>Front-End Technology</h4>
                <br>Front-end design
                <br>* This deals with the presentation of a website to the user
                <br>* Front-end development is a slightly different focus than Front-end design, but they have multiple skills in common and are sometimes used interchangeably
                <br>HTML, language of the web
                <br>* HTML 2.0 was released in 1995 and was the first release intended to be a ‘standard’
                <br>* XML 2 was so broken that a group separate from the W3C formed and drafted HTML5
                <br>Structuring HTML
                <br>* Organized with tags that identify the different parts of a web page’s structure
                <br>* CSS can be added to each tag individually, applying styles to groups of tags at the same time depending on their function and the needs of the site
                <br>Controlling presentation through CSS
                <br>* Cascading is a major feature of CSS that allows for detailed manipulation of content in HTML tags based on the tags themselves, classes, and ID’s
                <br>* Having style (CSS) and structure (HTML) as separate components allows for greater portability and less dependency
                <br>Client-side scripting with JavaScript
                <br>* Frameworks are libraries that already have functions and objects built-in
                <br>* Start with native JavaScript, then branch out to frameworks</p>
