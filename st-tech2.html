        <p>     <br><h4>Front-End Technology (continued)</h4>
                <br>Common Image Types
                <br>* Need to find a balance between image quality and file size
                <br>* Knowing the specific capabilities and trade-offs of each format allows devs to make the best decision for the site
                <br>What’s an API
                <br>* At its core, an API is a way for a service to be used on other sites or in other programs by providing a set of instructions/services for developers to use
                <br>* APIs are not the same as the sites themselves
                <br>HTML5 APIs
                <br>* After being first developed by the WHATWG, W3C broke the HTML5 API into multiple parts that allowed them to develop separately
                <br>* HTML5 APIs include Media, Drag-and-Drop, and App Cache. Separate APIs include Canvas and Geolocation
                <br>Web Fonts
                <br>* Temporary fonts used by CSS @font-face rule
                <br>* After legal and security issues were resolved, font creators have assisted in the adoption of web fonts
                <br>
                <br><h4>Back-End Technology</h4>
                <br>Server-side scripting
                <br>* Anything that happens on the server: registering new users, confirming purchase, etc
                <br>* SS Scripts run on the server before the page is presented to the user. Load is on the server, but scripts are hidden from the end user
                <br>The importance of PHP
                <br>* PHP became a key feature of websites when combined with Apache and MySQL
                <br>* PHP is a scripting language, and when a webserver sees a file with the .php extension, it understands that processing is required before the page can be presented to the user
                <br>Other popular server languages
                <br>* Includes: Java Server Pages, VB.NET, Coldfusion, Python, Ruby
                <br>* Choosing a language depends on cost, developer availability, and ease of use
                <br>Dealing with data
                <br>* On the browser, it’s cookies or key-value pairs. With JavaScript, XML and JSON files are used. For larger applications, a database is necessary.
                <br>* Normally only server side, Indexed DB and Web SQL are browser side databases
                <br>* Two types of databases: Relational and Non-relational. Relational DBs are organized by a schema that describes how tables are linked and related to each other. NoSQL DBs are flat and easier to index.
                <br>Using SQL databases
                <br>* Simple syntax: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
                <br>* Multple versions of SQL, often proprietary
                <br>Content management systems
                <br>* Designers can create templates that media and other content can be applied to the structure.
                <br>* Often uses WYSIWYG style editing so that non-technical end users can manage the site after the development is complete.
                <br>* Popular CMS: Joomla, Drupal, Movable Type, ModX, Radiant, WordPress, and Expression Engine
                <br>Content delivery networks
                <br>* CDN is way to deliver content via a distributed network of servers worldwide
                <br>* Specific parts of a site can be offloaded to a CDN to improve load times overall as well as reduce your own servers overhead.
                <br>Cloud services
                <br>* Using someone else’s computer as a way to have files/content available wherever there is an internet connection
                <br>* Built with the same tech used for websites (Ruby, .NET, Java, JavaScript) but are architected differently and need to be scalable
                <br>What is GitHub
                <br>* Online distribution service providing version control that was built around Git
                <br>* The forking and merging process that is part of GitHub has helped the FOSS community grow quickly
                <br>
                <br><h4>Assembly Technologies</h4>
                <br>JavaScript libraries
                <br>* Pre-written javascript code that makes it easier to do common tasks
                <br>* Increases capabilities of the site and the developer, but also increases overhead to load the site initially. Important to know when a library is appropriate
                <br>Frameworks and boilerplates
                <br>* Collection of prebuilt HTML/CSS/JS files that allow quick site development
                <br>* Comprehensive frameworks are a whole-page style that include everything a developer will likely ever need. Other minimalist frameworks only provide the basics and leave most of the styling up to the developer.
                <br>* Not always right for every project
                <br>CSS preprocessors
                <br>* Extends CSS with new syntax, then compiles the script to regular CSS
                <br>* Can add functionality to CSS and handle browser inconsistencies. Can also create problems when working with other developers and adds a layer of complexity.</p>
